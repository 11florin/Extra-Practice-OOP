# Contact Manager App (Java)

A simple **console-based Contact Manager** written in Java.  
This project demonstrates **basic object-oriented programming concepts** such as encapsulation, constructors, copying objects, and managing a collection of objects.

---

## üìå Features
- Stores and displays a list of **8 default contacts**.
- Each contact has:
  - Name
  - Phone number
  - Birth date
  - Age (calculated automatically from the birth date)
- Edit contacts by selecting their index (0‚Äì7).
- Updates the contact list in real time after editing.
- Uses **OOP best practices**:
  - Separate classes for `Contact`, `ContactManager`, and `Main`.
  - Constructor overloading and a copy constructor.
  - Encapsulation with getters and setters.
  - `toString()` override for neat contact display.
